# Number-Guessing-Game

This is a fun Python game where the computer picks a random number and you try to guess it. You get to choose the difficulty level, and the game tells you if your guesses are getting closer or farther from the correct number. Some features I implemented were helpful hints, counts of how many guesses you use, and the option to play again after each round.
